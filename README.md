Alright, I'm not going to start with a deep dive into DuckLake's architecture or get overly technical.
The goal of this post is simple: help you get DuckLake up and running quickly so you can start experimenting right away. That's it - no fluff, just a fast track to hands-on testing.
This is just the beginning - 
I plan to share more lakehouse architectures using different tools in future posts.
Enjoy the ride!
